![Pacman, the Pacman](Week 4 PacMan\PacMan1.png)

## Description
Pacman is a game character which is used in this project to simply move back and forth between   the window boundaries with some facial expressions. 

## Details
By setting the time intervals, we can loop pacman to bounce continually. Finding the current position is the key to change the direction.   
For the animation used 4 images which will be switched based on direction and focus.

## Support
MDN and stack overflow are some best resources from where we can get javascript syntax and other programming solutions.

## Roadmap
We can work on pacman going across the page and changing the color or size etc.
